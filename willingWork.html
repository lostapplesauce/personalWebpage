                <p>I am wanting to find a programming job to fulfill my desire in working in the 
                    industry.  Have <b>drive</b> to learn what I need to do.  Past jobs did not give 
                    me the challenge that programming does.  There always seems to be something to learn 
                    to keep my knowledge growing. <br/>
                    Thank you reading this over.
